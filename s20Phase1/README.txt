This is project 1.
Circular Dynamic Array that doubles whenever the array is full and reduces to half when only 25% of the array is filled.
Implements sorting algorithms such as QuickSort, Insortion Sort, Selection Sort and Counting Sort.
Also implements quick select and binary search

Future Updates:
May add IntroSort for a quicker O(lgN) sorting algorithm.
