Phase2 is graded differently than Phase1. The first 10 lines are checked to make sure the output is correct. The entire line has to be correct to get points for that line. After the first 10 lines the large cases are checked to see how many times the output is incorrect. 4 point is awarded for a line that reads passed and ADD+1 awards 1 point per line. The correct output is supplied as file CorrectoResult.out.
